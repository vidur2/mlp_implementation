# MLP Implementation on the Blockchain
This project is meant to be an expansion upon the <a href="https://github.com/vidur2/perception_test_on_blockchain">single perceptron project</a>.
This is currently a work in progress, but the single-layer perceptron is fully functional.

You can view a deployment of the contract <a href="https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/4uo4MciiLTfbdFvV3zzciMMBJ8eQaNDV7NytieB72N9K">here</a>.
